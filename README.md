# Secret Hitler 55
(an edit of secret hitler consolidator edition)

This is an edit of Lost Savage's script for secret hitler. This script adds things described in the readme and workshop page
This was thrown together in less than a day, so it isn't the most refined even if it has no errors. (the code looks sloppy)
Also contained is the playerlist and timer for Nikos.

  player list: simply shows who joined in what order so you can more easily decide who should be seated when there are many spectators

  Nikos timer: a timer that has a settable timer for how long turns should last before everyone is muted and the play has to be done. it also has the option for adding time for a player, when they hit the button the table should be quiet for the time and let them talk.
